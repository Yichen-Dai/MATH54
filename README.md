# UC Berkeley Math 54, Spring 2020

This is a repository for the course [Math 54: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations](https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/spring-2020-math-54-001-lec) in Spring 2020.

This repository contains most of the information you need for this course (lecture notes, assignments). Course sensitive information (exam, grade distribution etc) will be posted on [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1488929) (CalNet ID required).

## General information

Please read the [**Course Policy**](others/CoursePolicy.pdf) **VERY CAREFULLY**  

Instructor: Lin Lin. https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/

Lecture: Dwinelle 155  MoWeFr 02:00PM - 02:59PM

Office Hours: Mo 12:30PM-2:00PM Evans 1083 (office hours may change occasionally, so please check this website first before you come to the office hour each time)



**Textbook:** *Linear algebra and differential equations, custom edition for UC Berkeley*.  **ISBN:** 9781323720868

![textbook_1](lectures/assets/textbook_1.png)

This consists of selected chapters from the two books *Linear algebra and its applications, 5th edition* by David C. Lay, and *Fundamentals of differential equations, 9th edition* by R. Kent Nagle, Edward B. Saff and Arthur David Snider. It is fine to use the latter two books instead of the custom edition.

Previous versions of the custom edition, or the separate textbooks as above **may work, but it is your responsibility to make sure that you are doing the correct problem sets for your homework.**

## Announcement

- The first discussion session starts on 1/23 (Thursday).
- Again, there is no make-up final exam.
- 1/24: The homework refers to the problem sets in the new textbook (listed above). This includes the first homework due on 1/28. The Department of Mathematics is informing the Student Store to have more copies of the textbook available, and will deliver a few more textbooks to the Moffitt Library as course reserves.
- 1/28: We do not use gradescope for homework. All homework should be turned in during the discussion session.

## Part 1. Linear algebra, first half.
